Therefore, you need to ensure that each subtask you decomposed contains sufficient information to solve the subtask, such as the input (file localtion, url, etc.), output, and the expected result's content and format, etc.
For example, if detailed background information is provided in the original problem, it is necessary to restate the original background information in your decomposed task so that the agent can understand what is happening.
In particular, you must explicitly set the last subtask to generate output in the format required by the original problem based on the existing results, and transform the original problem in this subtask so that the agent can follow it. 
In the final subtask, you should explicitly let Answerer to complete the task. You can transform the original problem into a special format to prefer the agent to answer with only a short word, phrase, or number, because the correct answer is always short and clear (single word, phrase, or number).
